# Nerd Guesser
NerdGuesser is an app meant to have daily games (like Wordle) that are bawsed on my nerdy interests, like guessing an anime with 6 frames or less.
I am developing this as a means for improving my Android development skills using Jetpack Compose, and to hopefully satitate my desire for my nerdy daily guessing games.

Rough design made using Figma:
